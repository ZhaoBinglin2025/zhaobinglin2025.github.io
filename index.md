# About Me

<img src="/images/2.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="about-me-photo">

I am currently a **Master’s student at {{ site.owner.university }}**, working in the *{{ site.owner.lab }}* at the {{ site.owner.department }}, supervised by [**{{ site.owner.advisor }}**]({{ site.owner.advisor_url }}).
Previously, I was a visiting research student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by [**Prof. Feng Zheng**](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en)(a recipient of the National Excellent Young Scientist Award), where I worked on trustworthy diffusion models and content security in AIGC. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Security from Qingdao University, where I conducted research under [**Prof. Hanlin Zhang**](https://cst.qdu.edu.cn/info/1072/7423.htm) — who completed his Ph.D. under [**Prof. Wei Yu**](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/facultystaff/wyu.html), an NSF CAREER Awardee — focusing on privacy-preserving outsourcing computation and secure IoT systems. These experiences equipped me with solid research training in cybersecurity and trustworthy AI, providing a strong algorithmic foundation that now supports my interdisciplinary work in **AI for Energy and Sustainability**.

I am always open to discussions and collaborations — feel free to [**email me**](mailto:{{ site.owner.email }}).
